# MyExpenses-ReactExpress

This is a small budgeting application I built to practice implementing different types of REST APIs. I came accross some great advice once that mentioned a good way to practice and learn new technologies is to build different versions of the same application. This is exactly that.

This version contains a frontend built with React and Redux and it implements the backend with a REST API built with Express. The application has authentication, and allows users to log in and track their expenses. A handy chart breaks down the expenses by category.

This application is deployed here:
https://myexpenses-reactexpress.onrender.com/

demo user:
<br>
email: `test@test.com`
<br>
password: `pass`

The backend repo for this app can be found here:
